      "content": "# 3.4 Outbound Configuration\n\nOutbound Configuration defines the overall setup for managing outbound operations in the warehouse, including task behavior, execution sequences, and bin assignment logic. It ensures that outbound processes like picking, sorting, packing, loading etc. follow defined rules and strategies.\n\nOutbound Configuration setup is in three steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: Outbound Task configuration\n- **Step 2**: Outbound Task Sequence Configuration\n- **Step 3**: Outbound Bin Search Configuration\n\n---\n\n### 3.4.1 Outbound Task Configurations\n\nOutbound Task Configuration defines how picking, sorting, loading, and drop operations are executed in a warehouse for outbound flows. It includes task types, HU Strategies, scanning rules, and fulfillment behaviors, offering granular control over task execution and flexibility in outbound processes.\n\n| Field | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `whId` | Warehouse identifier |\n| `taskType` | Type of task (e.g., PICK, LOAD) |\n| `huHandlingStrategy` | Strategy for handling HUs during tasks |\n| `scanType` | Scanning behavior required during task |\n| `fulfillmentType` | Fulfillment logic to be applied |\n| `priority` | Task execution priority |\n| `enabled` | Whether the task is active or not |\n\n---\n\n### 3.4.2 Outbound Task Sequence\n\nOutbound Task Sequence defines the ordered flow of warehouse operations during outbound processing, such as picking, replenishment, loading. It allows configuring execution logic based on SKU, channel, or UOM-specific criteria.\n\n| Field | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `sequenceId` | Unique identifier for the sequence step |\n| `taskType` | Task associated with this step |\n| `order` | Execution order of the task |\n| `skipIfNotApplicable` | Whether to skip if task is not needed |\n| `uomGroup` | Applicable UOM group for the task |\n| `channelType` | Channel type condition for execution |\n\n---\n\n### 3.4.3 Outbound Bin Search Configurations\n\nOutbound Bin Search Configuration defines how the system identifies the most appropriate bin for picking or putting inventory during outbound operations. It uses filters like SKU attributes, zone preferences, and inventory states to optimize bin assignment logic.\n\n| Field | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| `filterType` | Type of bin filter applied (e.g., zone, attribute) |\n| `binRankingStrategy` | Strategy used to rank bins |\n| `allowPartial` | Whether partial bin matches are allowed |\n| `inventoryState` | Required inventory condition (e.g., AVAILABLE) |\n| `preferredZones` | List of preferred zones for bin selection |",
